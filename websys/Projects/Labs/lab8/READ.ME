I learned a reasonable amount about SQL commands in order to do this lab so I am happy woth the fact that I now have a better working knowedge of SQL. I had trouble with question 8 initially because I needed to figure out how to get all of that detail in one command. Once I learned the operators, however, I got a better feel for how I was supposed to make it work. All-in-all, SQL seems like a very useful tool for managing databases because it seems deceptively powerful.
