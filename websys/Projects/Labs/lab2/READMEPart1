Lab 2 Part 1

I chose 6 songs that I really like to listen to for this playlist. I decided to mark up the information in the way that I did because I wanted each song to be seperate and moveable. That is why I put them all in their own seperate divs. The size of the headers decreases as I feel information gets less important until information is just in paragraphs. I enjoy working with html. It's intuitive and very useful.
