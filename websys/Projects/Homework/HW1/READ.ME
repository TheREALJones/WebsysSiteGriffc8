Assignment 1
I used HTML because it is effective and flexible for making attractive webpages. HTML is the proper markup for this because it is a language that very easily translates to effective webpages. My document is semantically correct because it only uses tags that work within HTML and every tag that is opened is closed without overlapping. I used divs in my document in order to create the nested columns effect that we discussed in class earlier. I also see it as a very effective way of organizing related information and moving it if it is so required. The hCard information I added is useful for humans because they can read the classes and understand what each line means. A program will also see the class and since the hCard format is standardized it will understand what each line means.
