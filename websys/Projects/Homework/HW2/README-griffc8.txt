1)What are the advantages to writing a jQuery plugin over regular JavaScript that uses jQuery?
Making an additional plugin allows you to make personalitzed methods that make sense within the particular project and makes coding more efficient.

2) Explain how your jQuery plugin adheres to best practices in JavaScript and jQuery development.
Our plugin uses all of the appropiate syntax and spacing expected of it. Our javascript and jQuery is well formed and efficient. The plugin saves time for this project as it was designed to do and everything in the plugin is used in the project.

3) Does anything prevent you from POSTing high scores to a server on a different domain? If so, what? If not, how would we go about it (written explanation/pseudocode is fine here)?
Nothing prevents us from putting a high-score in a database and pulling that score from the database whenever someone opens the page. We could have an element on the html with a specific ID that gets the high score added to it and update the score on the database whenever it gets beaten.
