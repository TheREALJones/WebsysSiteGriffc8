I don't intend to use this as my email signature. I don't yet have enough information that I feel people need to know to put in a reasonably sized signature. I added the additional wording in order to give me more text to pla with. I am a little rusty with CSS because I haven't used it in quite some time but I was glad to get the opportunity to practice it again before I had to do more intesive work with it.
